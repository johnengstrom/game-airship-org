let _scenarios = ["The Plight of the Pangolin:  Pangolins, often described as shy and reclusive, have faced relentless threats from illegal wildlife trade.In Africa alone, poaching claims the lives of up to 2.7 million pangolins annually.Their meat is a coveted delicacy in parts of Asia, while their scales and even fetuses are misguidedly used in traditional medicine.This merciless exploitation has rendered them the most heavily trafficked wild mammal worldwide.  A Beacon of Hope:  In a world where such grim narratives are common, Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk have emerged as harbingers of hope.Thanks to the unwavering support of donors, a significant milestone was recently achieved - the completion of a new pangolin enclosure in Vietnam.This facility isnt just a safe haven; its a cornerstone in the fight for the pangolins survival.  The New Enclosure: A Sanctuary for Recovery and Growth:  The enclosure, a blend of ingenuity and compassion, offers these rescued pangolins a nurturing environment.It includes features like a large tube with small holes, simulating a natural hunting experience for these ant - eating mammals.This innovative design is a significant upgrade from their previous, unnatural feeding methods.The facility also incorporates domes to replicate the pangolins natural habit of coiling in underground nests, adapting to their inability to dig deep in the facility.  Celebration and Continuous Efforts:  The completion of this enclosure is a cause for celebration, marking a pivotal moment in pangolin conservation.It symbolizes not just a safe space for these creatures but a step forward in their species recovery through a planned breeding program.The upcoming launch of a LIVE Nest Cam will offer the world a glimpse into the lives of these pangolins as they adapt to their new home.      Conclusion:  The story of the pangolins is a stark reminder of the fragility of our natural world and the consequences of human actions.Yet, it also exemplifies the power of collective effort and the impact of compassionate stewardship.As Greater Good Charities continues its vital work, they remind us of our responsibility and ability to effect change, urging continued support in protecting wildlife around the globe.  Support the Effort:  Join the mission to safeguard wildlife by supporting Greater Good Charities.Your contribution can make a difference in the lives of countless endangered species including the precious pangolins.", "Game Description: Airship Game - Operation Pollination.
