  "gameDescription": "Two futuristic airships, provided by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, are on a mission to transport rescued pangolins from high-risk poaching regions in Africa to safety in the new enclosure in Vietnam. As the captains of the airships, teams of players need to make decisions that affect the success of the mission and the welfare of endangered pangolins, while minimizing environmental impact. All the while, they're in a race against time as the relentless illegal wildlife trade continues to threaten the pangolins.",
