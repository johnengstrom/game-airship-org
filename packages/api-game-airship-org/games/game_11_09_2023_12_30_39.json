  "gameDescription": "In a world where illegal wildlife trade wreaks havoc, Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk come together to save the world's most heavily poached and trafficked mammal - the pangolin. Cast as intelligent airships from two elite squadrons, players are tasked with a trailblazing eco-mission: to safely and efficiently transport rescued pangolins over a vast expanse from Africa to a newly constructed enclosure in Vietnam. Every strategic decision players make during this rescue odyssey encapsulates weighty dilemmas - priorities of time, mission safety, resource conservation, and impacts on environment and wildlife.",
