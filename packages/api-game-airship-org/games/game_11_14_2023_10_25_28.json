  "gameDescription": "In 'Operation Pollination', players take control of advanced airships in a near future where the survival of bees and the global ecosystem hangs in the balance. The game fosters strategic decision-making and underlines the importance of environmental conservation, specifically focusing on the critical role bees play in our ecosystem. By uniting to restore bee populations and habitats, decimated by natural disasters and human activities, players will navigate through three turns of strategic challenges, make tough choices, and experience the far-reaching effects of their decisions.",
