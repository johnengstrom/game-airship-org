  "gameTitle": "Rescue to Recovery: The Pangolin Journey",
  "gameDescription": "Two futuristic airships, donated by the generous philanthropists, have been specifically retrofitted to assist Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk in their work of rescuing and rehabilitating pangolins, the world's most heavily trafficked mammal. They are about to embark on a mission of love and valor, transporting recovered pangolins from various points across Africa to the safety of the new enclosure in Vietnam. Each decision made by the airship crews affects the success of this life-saving mission and the revival of these endangered species.",
