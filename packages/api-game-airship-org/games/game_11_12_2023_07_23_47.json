  "gameDescription": "In a world where wildlife trafficking poses a major threat to species like pangolins, advanced airships use intelligent technology to transport rescued animals to safe facilities and participate in missions that directly combat against wildlife poaching. Representing tech-enabled conservation organizations, two teams, the Red Team and the Blue Team, embark on a series of challenges where their strategic decisions directly impact the success of their mission to transport and protect pangolins, as well as the overall environmental impact. Their actions will decide the fate of the world's most heavily trafficked wild mammal.",
