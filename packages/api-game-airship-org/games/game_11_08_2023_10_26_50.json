  "gameTitle": "Airship Endeavour: Rescue of the Pangolins",
  "gameDescription": "In a world afflicted by reckless wildlife exploitation, two futuristic airships unite on a crucial mission. Controlled by the Red Team as 'Shield Havens' and the Blue Team as 'Wildlife Saviors', these intelligent airships are tasked with transporting rescued pangolins from poaching areas in Africa to a newly built enclosure in Vietnam. Their cargo is precious and sensitive; hence their decisions significantly influence the pangolins' survival rates and the overall success of the mission.",
