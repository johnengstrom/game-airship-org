  "gameDescription": "In the near future, the pristine wilderness of Antarctica faces a new challenge: the surge in tourism. As the captains of futuristic airships, similar to those in Arthur C Clarke's novel 'The Songs of Distant Earth', players yield the responsibility of this delicately balanced environment. They must strategically navigate the intricacies of facilitating scientific research, sustainable exploration, and the growing demand for tourism, all the while aimed at preserving the unique, untouched ecosystem.",
