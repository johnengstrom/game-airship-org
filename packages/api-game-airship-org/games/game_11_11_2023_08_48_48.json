  "gameDescription": "As the captains of futuristic airships, players are faced with the task of navigating the pristine wilderness of Antarctica, balancing the soaring demand for tourism with the dire need to preserve the unique ecosystem. With tourism at a surge, the onus is on the players to choose between popular and potentially impacted areas, untouched and pristine locations for landing sites. Each decision contributes to a myriad of environmental outcomes, affecting Antarctica's biodiversity and the overall sustainability of our Antarctic exploration. The challenge here is to integrate strategic gameplay with real-world issues, and educate players on the complexities of tourism in Antarctica.",
