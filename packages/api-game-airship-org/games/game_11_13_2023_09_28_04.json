  "gameTitle": "Operation Pangolin Rescue",
  "gameDescription": "In the midst of an ecological crisis, two advanced airships, the Arcadia's Trust and Zahara's Shield, are embarking on a mission to transport rescued pangolins from Africa to a newly built safe haven in Vietnam. The cargo is precious â€“ a group of pangolins saved from poachers, to be introduced into a special enclosure built by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk. Every decision made by the airship crews, from dealing with unexpected obstacles to conserving fuel made from eco-friendly biohydrogen, affects the survival of their priceless cargo and the environment.",
