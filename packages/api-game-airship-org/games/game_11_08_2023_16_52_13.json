  "gameDescription": "An urgent call in a world where conservation battles against poaching. Two futuristic airships, operating under the Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, embark on a multi-step mission. Their goal: to rescue Pangolins from African poaching territories and transport them to a newly-built sanctuary in Vietnam. The intricacy of this mission requires high-level strategizing as each decision impacts the Pangolin rescue success, the lifespan of the airships, and the overall environmental footprint.",
