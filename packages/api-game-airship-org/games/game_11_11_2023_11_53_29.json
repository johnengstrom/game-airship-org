  "gameDescription": "Two airships from Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk are tasked with an urgent eco-mission. In alarming numbers, the shy Pangolins are being poached, rendering them the most heavily trafficked wild mammal worldwide. It becomes the teams' responsibility to safely transport young pangolins from dangerous poaching territories in Africa to a recently built, state-of-the-art enclosure in Vietnam. Decisions made during this critical journey impact the survival of these endangered pangolins and the environment.",
