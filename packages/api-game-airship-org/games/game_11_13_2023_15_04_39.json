  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Resurgence: The Airship Aid",
  "gameDescription": "Human beings have driven shy and reclusive pangolins to the brink of extinction, poaching an estimated 2.7 million annually for their meat and scales. However, Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk are fighting against this grim narrative, having recently completed a new pangolin enclosure in Vietnam. In this game, two teams of futuristic airships, dubbed the 'Life Bringers' and the 'Eco Angels', are tasked with airlifting rescued pangolins to this sanctuary. Their time-sensitive missions involve strategic decision-making that impacts the pangolins' survival and their airships' environmental footprint.",
