  "gameTitle": "Airship Aid: The Pangolin Mission",
  "gameDescription": "Two advanced airships, the Orion's Wing and the Sirius Carrier, undertake a crucial mission to secure the future of Pangolins. Poaching claims the lives of about 2.7 million pangolins annually in Africa alone, making them the most heavily trafficked wild mammals worldwide. Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk have built a safe haven in Vietnam, and our airships are charged with the task of transporting rescued pangolins from Africa to this sanctuary. Throughout the journey, strategic decisions must be made that affect not only the mission but also the impact on our precious environment.",
