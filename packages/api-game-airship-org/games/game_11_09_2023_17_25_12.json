  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Plight: The Rescue Mission",
  "gameDescription": "In the year 2054, airships are the primary mode of cargo transport. The red and blue teams, known as The Earth Guardians, take on a high-stakes mission. Their aim is to safely carry pangolin specimens and transport them along with their man-made habitat across the globe from Africa to a new sanctuary in Vietnam. This secure haven was jointly built by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk. The airship teams are tasked with outmaneuvering poachers and traffickers while maintaining the critical health of the pangolins and integrity of their habitat structure. Each decision will impact the pangolins, their habitat, and the mission's success, shifting the balance between human thriving and the continued existence of the earth's most trafficked mammal.",
