  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players commandeer advanced intelligent airships to implement strategic missions aimed at restoring bee populations and habitats affected by natural disasters and human activities. Teams, the Apis Aviators (Red Team) and the Bombus Navigators (Blue Team), make critical decision that affect both the success of their mission and the impact on the ecosystems they intervene in. In this game, the players are not just on a mission to help the bees survive, but they are tasked with the survival of the global ecosystem.",
