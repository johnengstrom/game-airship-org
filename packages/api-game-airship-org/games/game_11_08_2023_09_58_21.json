  "gameTitle": "Aerial Sanctuary: Pangolin Rescue",
  "gameDescription": "In the clandestine world of global wildlife trade, pangolins hold the unfortunate title of being the most trafficked. The world has called upon two airship teams, Sky Caretakers and Winged Guardians, in a mission to preserve the pangolins. Your strategic decisions on their crucial journey from Africa to a newly constructed sanctuary in Vietnam would mean survival or loss for these endangered creatures. You must decide how to best navigate the obstacles, manage resources and time, and cooperate with global wildlife protection organizations. Remember, each choice you make impacts not just the success of this green voyage but also the future of pangolins.",
