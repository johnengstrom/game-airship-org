  "gameDescription": "Assume control of intelligent airships, the 'Skyward Sanctuary' of the Blue Team, and the 'Aeroboreal Habitat' of the Red Team. In a mission defined by compassion, your cargo consists of pangolins, the world's most heavily trafficked wild mammal. Your objective: to transport these vulnerable creatures safely from a poaching hotbed in Africa to a specifically designed sanctuary in Vietnam. Your choices en route will dictate not only the efficiency of your mission, but also its impact on the wildlife you are sworn to protect.",
