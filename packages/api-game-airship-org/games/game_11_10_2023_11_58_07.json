  "gameTitle": "Operation Pollination: The Return of the Bees",
  "gameDescription": "As a response to the dwindling bee populations worldwide, two commandeer Airships named 'Apis Aviators' (Red Team) and 'Bombus Navigators' (Blue Team) are on a mission to restore bee habitats affected by both natural disasters and detrimental human activities. The balance hangs in the fast-paced decision-making and eco-strategic plotting as you either create healthier ecosystems or accelerate the spiralling descent of these essential pollinators. Your decisions will echo in the global circuit of life.",
