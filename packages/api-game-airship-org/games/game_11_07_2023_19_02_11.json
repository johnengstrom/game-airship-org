  "gameDescription": "In a futuristic world where intelligent airships are commonplace, two cutting-edge airships belonging to Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, embark on a crucial mission. The objective is to rescue pangolins from Africa and transport them safely to a new enclosure in Vietnam. These pangolins, shy and elusive, are victims of relentless illegal hunting. Poaching claims the lives of up to 2.7 million pangolins annually, pushing these unique mammals towards the brink of extinction. The challenge before the airship crews is not merely transportation; each decision they make affects the wellbeing of the pangolins and the environmental impact of the mission.",
