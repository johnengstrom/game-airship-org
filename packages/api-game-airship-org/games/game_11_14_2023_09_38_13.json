  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Passage: The Aerial Aid",
  "gameDescription": "Two futuristic airships, with their advanced cargo capacities and navigational systems, embark on a revolutionary eco-mission to aid pangolins, the most heavily trafficked wild mammals worldwide. Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk have partnered to establish a new pangolin enclosure in Vietnam as a sanctuary for sustainable population recovery. The airship teams are tasked with transporting essential construction materials, pangolin-specific equipment, and eventually the pangolins themselves to this new haven. Players of each team must make strategic decisions high in the skies that affect both the success of the mission and the welfare of these endangered creatures.",
