  "gameTitle": "Mission Pangolin: The Airship Rescue",
  "gameDescription": "In a bold compassionate effort, two teams, Athena Navigators and Glaucus Guardians, control intelligent airships on a vital mission - rescuing pangolins, the most heavily trafficked wildlife mammals, and transporting them to a new sanctuary in Vietnam designed for their survival and recovery. The teams have to ensure that they minimise the environmental impact and maintain the physical and mental health of the pangolins during transport.",
