  "gameDescription": "In the not-so-distant future, two teams of airship operators, 'Sky Shepherds' and 'AeroSentinels', find themselves on a mission to transport essential supplies, veterinary experts, and groundbreaking habitat modeling technology to a newly established pangolin sanctuary in Vietnam. As they traverse across nations and oceans from their Africa-based wildlife workstation, they must strategize their choices to ensure the safety and well-being of the cargo, all while maintaining their stringent eco-protocols.",
