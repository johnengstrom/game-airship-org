  "gameTitle": "Aeronauts for Pangolins: Operation Rescue Sandscale",
  "gameDescription": "In a world where humans encroach on wildlife, pangolins have fallen victim to rampant illegal trade, pushing them towards extinction. Two futuristic airship teams, born from a partnership between the global Greater Good Charities and the techno-pioneers of Wildlife At Risk, embark on an altruistic mission. Their goal is to rescue pangolins from poaching hotspots, transport them across territorial boundaries, and settle them in the newly established sanctuary in Vietnam. Every decision made by the hardy crews will impact not only the success of the mission, but also the crucial question of human-animal cohabitation on Earth. Featuring cutting-edge airship tech and gritty on-ground conservation challenges, players will need to navigate through tricky scenarios to ensure the safety and survival of the precious cargo.",
