  "gameTitle": "Airship Rescue: Pangolin Plight",
  "gameDescription": "Deforestation and illegal hunting have driven pangolins, the world's most trafficked mammal, to the brink of extinction in Asia and Africa. Two futuristic airships, operated by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, embark on an eco-mission to transport rescued pangolins from poaching hotspots to a newly completed sanctuary in Vietnam. The teams engage in strategic decision-making to ensure the safe transport of these vulnerable creatures, negotiate with air traffic control, and coordinate with local conservation agencies. The outcome of their actions affects the success of the mission and the future of the pangolin species.",
