  "gameTitle": "Skyward Saviors: The Pangolin Rescue",
  "gameDescription": "Control advanced airships of two critical teams, the 'Guardians of Sky' and the 'Winged Saviors', in a race against time to save pangolins, the most heavily trafficked wild mammal worldwide. Both teams take on the daunting task of transporting rescued pangolins from various risky locations to the new pangolin enclosure in Vietnam, a haven constructed by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife at Risk. This eco-mission weighs heavy on each strategic decision, as it affects both the successful relocation of these endangered creatures and your fuel consumption, ultimately impacting environmental sustainability.",
