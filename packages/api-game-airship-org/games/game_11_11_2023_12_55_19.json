  "gameTitle": "Rescue Wings: Pangolin Protection Mission",
  "gameDescription": "Two state-of-the-art airships, lent by the philanthropic organisations, Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, embark on a critical mission to rescue pangolins from rampant poaching in Africa, and transport them to a newly constructed sanctuary in Vietnam. They must navigate strategically through difficult conditions and threats to ensure the safety and well-being of this nearly extinct species. Every decision carries a massive impact not only on the success of their mission but also on biodiversity preservation.",
