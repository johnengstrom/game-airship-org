  "gameDescription": "In a time when wildlife like the shy and reclusive pangolins face relentless threats from illegal wildlife trade, two futuristic airships, backed by the unwavering support of donors, are tasked with transporting vital equipment, donated resources and medical supplies to a newly built pangolin sanctuary in Vietnam. Flying over different terrains, the airship crews must make strategic decisions that will impact the success of their mission, the well-being of the endangered pangolins and the environmental implications of their choices.
