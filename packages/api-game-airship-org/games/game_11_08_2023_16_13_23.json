  "gameDescription": "The worldâ€™s most heavily trafficked wild mammal, the Pangolin, is at the brink of extinction due to relentless poaching. To combat this, two airship teams embark on a critical eco-mission. The teams are tasked with transporting essential resources for the development of a new pangolin enclosure in Vietnam. A combination of skilful navigation, strategic planning and efficient use of resources will ensure the successful completion of the mission in the most environmentally friendly manner.",
