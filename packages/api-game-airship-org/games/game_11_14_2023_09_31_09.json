  "gameDescription": "In a challenging mission of compassion, two futuristic airships - Aeolus Wings and Poseidon Carriers - are tasked with delivering life-saving supplies to boost pangolin conservation efforts in Vietnam. Heralds in the sky, they stand against illegal wildlife trade, poaching, and gnawing threats of extinction that pangolins face. Each decision made by the airship crews affects not only the success of the mission but also paves the way for future wildlife conservation endeavors. Success isn't just about delivery but how it is executed - efficiently, sustainably, and without disturbance to the ecosystem.",
