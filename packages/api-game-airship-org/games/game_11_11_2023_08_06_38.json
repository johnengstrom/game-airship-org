  "gameTitle": "Antarctic Challenge: Balance of Wilderness",
  "gameDescription": "In the near future, the pristine wilderness of Antarctica faces a new challenge: the surge in tourism. As the captains of futuristic intelligent airships, players are tasked with maintaining the delicacy and uniqueness of the Antarctic landscape while balancing the overwhelming demand for exploration. Each decision made will either enable or compromise sustainable exploration and scientific research, and will have consequences to the Antarctic's unique ecosystem. A wrong choice could be catastrophic.",
