  "gameTitle": "Airship Game - Operation Pollination",
  "gameDescription": "As pioneering Apis Aviators and Bombus Navigators, players helm high-tech airships in a near future where the world's bee populations are at risk. Through strategic decision-making and environmental conservation in three intriguing missions, players work to restore bee habitats affected by natural disasters and anthropogenic factors. Operation Pollination not only tests your strategies, but also educates you about the indispensable role of bees in our ecosystems.",
