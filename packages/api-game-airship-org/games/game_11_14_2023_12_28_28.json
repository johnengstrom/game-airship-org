  "gameTitle": "Operation Pollination: Airship Rescue",
  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players command advanced airships of the 'Apis Aviators' and the 'Bombus Navigators' teams in a near-future where the survival of bees and the global ecosystem are at stake. With the objective of restoring bee populations and habitats affected by natural disasters and human activities, three strategic missions are presented that demand strategic decision-making and a commitment to environmental conservation. The game balances the urgency of immediate needs and long-term sustainability, echoing real-world challenges faced by our ecosystem due to habitat loss, climate change, and human intervention.",
