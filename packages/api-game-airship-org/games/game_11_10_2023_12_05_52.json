  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players commandeer advanced airships in a near future where the survival of bees and the global ecosystem is at stake. The game combines strategic decision-making with environmental conservation, focusing on the crucial role bees play in our world. As the Red and Blue teams, the Apis Aviators and Bombus Navigators respectively, your objective is to complete three strategic missions aimed at restoring bee populations and habitats affected by natural disasters and human activities.",
