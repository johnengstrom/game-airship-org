  "gameDescription": "In a futuristic world where airships are at the forefront of eco-friendly transportation, two teams - the 'Wildlife Guardians' and the 'Eco Saviors' - are on a mission to help endangered pangolins. Assigned by the Greater Good Charities, the objective is to transport rescued pangolins to a newly built safe-haven facility in Vietnam with minimal environmental impact. Each decision made by these teams, from route navigation to cargo management, directly affects the mission's success and the well-being of these precious creatures.",
