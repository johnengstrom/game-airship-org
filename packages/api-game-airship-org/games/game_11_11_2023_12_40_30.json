  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Paradox: The Flight to Freedom",
  "gameDescription": "Two advanced airships, 'Gaia Guardians' and 'Phoenix Paladins', are embarking on an urgent rescue mission in Africa. Tasked with the transport of critically endangered pangolins seized from illegal wildlife trade to a new sanctuary in Vietnam, their decisions will impact the lives of these precious creatures, as well as the environment. This game combines the harsh reality of wildlife trafficking, and the hopeful narrative of empathy provoked recovery and conservation efforts, aiming to engage players in a narrative that is as real as it is compelling. The airship crews must strategize to safely and sustainably transport these delicate beings to their new home.",
