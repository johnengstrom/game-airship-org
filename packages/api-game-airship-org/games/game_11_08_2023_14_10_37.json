  "gameDescription": "In a not so distant future, the untouched wilderness of our last frontier, Antarctica, is under threat due to booming tourism. As captains of sophisticated airships, players must navigate the pristine landscapes of this fragile habitat. Balancing between facilitating scientific research, sustainable exploration and minimizing environmental impact due to human intrusion becomes pivotal.",
