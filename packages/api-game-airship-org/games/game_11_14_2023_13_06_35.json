  "gameDescription": "In the untouched wilderness of Antarctica, Red Team and Blue Team helm their futuristic airships. The captains must navigate this sensitive landscape of ice and snow. As mass tourism surges into this pristine ecosystem, they must balance scientific research and exploration with the urgent need to protect the last great wilderness of our planet. Their ultimate objective is to navigate three turns of strategic decision-making to minimize the environmental impact of tourism in Antarctica, facilitating sustainable exploration and research.",
