  "gameTitle": "Operation Pollination",
  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players control advanced airships in a near-future mission to revitalize global bee populations, decimated by natural disasters and human activities. The airships, controlled by The Apis Aviators (Red Team) and The Bombus Navigators (Blue Team), transport strategic cargo to various locations, planting flowers, establishing colonies, and conducting essential conservation tasks. Balancing immediate needs against long-term sustainability and navigating an unpredictable environment are key to mission success.",
