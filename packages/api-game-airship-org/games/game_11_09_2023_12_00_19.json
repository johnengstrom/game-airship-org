  "gameTitle": "Airship Rescue: Pangolin Hope",
  "gameDescription": "Two futuristic airships, the Aquila Refuge and the Seraphim Sanctuary are commissioned by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk to transport essential equipment for the creation of the New Enclosure - a sanctuary for endangered pangolins in Vietnam. The pangolin rescue mission embodies the promise of artificial intelligence and airships to surmount logistical challenges, enabling remote, yet impactful humanitarian aid. The success of the mission and the lesser eco-impact remains at the crux of every strategic decision the airship crews make. A wrong step, and they endanger the pangolins further. A right move, and they create a beacon of hope for the world's most trafficked mammal.",
