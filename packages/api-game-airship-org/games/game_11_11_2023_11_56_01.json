  "gameTitle": "Operation Pollination: Bee Savior",
  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players take control of futuristic airships in a mission to save bees, the tiny soldiers of the global ecosystem. To thrive, the natural world needs bees for pollination, but numerous factors, including climate change and urbanization, are threatening their survival. As commanders of the Red Team (The Apis Aviators) or the Blue Team (The Bombus Navigators), players face three turns of strategic decision-making to help restore bee populations and their habitats in regions affected by natural disasters and human interventions.",
