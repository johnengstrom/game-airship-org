  "gameTitle": "Flight for Pangolins: A Green Hope",
  "gameDescription": "In a world fraught with risks to wildlife species, teams must pilot futuristic airships to transport sensitive cargo - rescued pangolins from Africa to a sanctuary in Vietnam. The sanctuary is a beacon of hope, built by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, offering a safe haven and a recovery environment for these most trafficked mammals. As airship crews, your strategic decisions will determine the success of this vital mission and the environmental impact it will make.",
