  "gameDescription": "Two intelligent airships known as 'Biosphere Pioneers' and 'EcoShields,' part of a larger initiative by Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, are partnered on an mission. Their task is transport essential resources required to establish further safe haven enclosures for pangolins across Vietnam, and rescue pangolins from illegal trafficking. The strategic decisions made by both airships would not only affect the success of this crucial mission, but also have an impact on the global fight for pangolin survival.",
