  "gameDescription": "In the throbbing heart of the wild, pangolins face a brutal reality, their numbers dwindling relentlessly due to illegal trafficking. Two powerful entities, Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk, have kindled a flare of hope, building a new enclosure providing a sanctuary for recovery and growth in Vietnam. As the commanders of two futuristic airships, Arcadia Whisper and Gaian's Grace, your mission is to ferry precious pangolins from perilous landscapes to this newfound haven. Navigate three strategic turns whilst managing fuel, and the life you transport and the ecological implications of every decision.",
