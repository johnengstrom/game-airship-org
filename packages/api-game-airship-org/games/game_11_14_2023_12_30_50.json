  "gameDescription": "In this airship game, players are tasked with a critical mission to combat wildlife trafficking in Africa and Asia. The Aeolus Wings and Poseidon Carriers fly to recovery missions where they rescue pangolins, the world's most heavily trafficked wild mammal, facing the challenges of inclement weather, poachers, and logistics. Their interventions don't simply bring the ailing pangolins to safety, but also to a newly built sanctuary in Vietnam that acts as a hope beacon for their survival, growth, and eventual reintroduction into the wild.",
