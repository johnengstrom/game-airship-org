  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Rescue: Mission Hope",
  "gameDescription": "As part of the Greater Good Charities Project Peril, two advanced airships embark on an urgent mission to rescue pangolins from illegal trafficking and transport them to a newly built haven in Vietnam. Each decision made by the airship teams affects not just the creature's survival, but also the efficiency of hydrogen use and the environmental impact of their actions. This game seeks to create awareness about the dire situation of the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin, and provoke strategic discussions around wildlife conservation.",
