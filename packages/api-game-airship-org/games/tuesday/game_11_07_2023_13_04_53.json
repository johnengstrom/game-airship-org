  "gameTitle": "Project Aether: Pangolin Rescue Mission",
  "gameDescription": "In a world pushed to the brink of an environmental crisis, two futuristic airship crews, loaded with mission-specific cargo and equipment, are tasked with rescuing and relocating the critically endangered pangolins. The teams must make strategic decisions to not only complete the mission successfully, but also to minimize environmental impact, reflecting the hard reality of wildlife conservation efforts. With each turn presenting a set of challenging scenarios, the collective decision of both teams impacts the narrative of the game and the fate of the pangolins.",
