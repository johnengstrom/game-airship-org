  "gameTitle": "Eco-Rush: Project Peril",
  "gameDescription": "Against a backdrop of heightened global concern for endangered species, two pioneering airships navigate on a mission to transport urgently required resources to Greater Good Charities' Project Peril. The mission objective centers on the construction of a sanctuary for pangolins, the world's most heavily trafficked mammal teetering on the brink of extinction. Every decision the teams make affects their mission's success, the survival of the pangolins, and the environment. Teams must make challenging decisions over three strategic turns, with no clear indication of the best choice. The nature of the teams' decisions and their strategic interaction will determine the narrative outcome and the potential bonus cards in play. Players can prepare to confront stark realities of wildlife conservation woven into deep narrative insights.",
