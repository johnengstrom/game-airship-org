  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players commandeer advanced airships in a near future where the survival of bees and the global ecosystem is at stake. The game combines strategic decision-making with environmental conservation, focusing on the crucial role bees play in our world. Players have the option of leading either The Apis Aviators (Red Team) or The Bombus Navigators (Blue Team) on three strategic missions aimed at restoring bee populations and habitats affected by natural disasters and human activities.",
