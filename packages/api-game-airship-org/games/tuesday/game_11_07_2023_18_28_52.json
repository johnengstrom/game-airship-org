  "gameTitle": "Airship Game - Operation Pollination",
  "gameDescription": "In Operation Pollination, players commandeer advanced airships in a near future where the survival of bees and the global ecosystem is at stake. Airships tackle challenging missions such as post-hurricane recovery and wildfire-affected areas restoration. Alongside, these mechanical giants also endeavour to establish bee colonies in unaffected regions to support displaced populations. The teams must balance their actions carefully, considering both the immediate needs and long-term sustainability of the bee populations.",
