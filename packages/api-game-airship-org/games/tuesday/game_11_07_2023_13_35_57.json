  "gameTitle": "Skybound Saviors: The Pangolin Paradox",
  "gameDescription": "Set amidst a backdrop of global wildlife conservation where Earth's valuable species teeter on the brink of extinction, two intelligent airship teams - red and blue, embark on strategic missions to save the pangolins, the most heavily trafficked wild mammal. The game involves the players in the transport of pangolins from the dangerous poaching zones to specific safe zones namely sanctuaries or reserves, wielding strategic options that will decide the fate of these creatures and that impact the environment.",
