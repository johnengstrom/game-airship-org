  "gameTitle": "Project Air: The Pangolin Rescue",
  "gameDescription": "In the face of a global wildlife crisis, two airships, controlled by players, embark on a critical mission to rescue and transport endangered pangolins from areas of conflict to a newly created safe haven in Vietnam. Throughout the journey, teams will be tasked with making crucial decisions that will influence not only the success of the operation and the lives of the pangolins, but also the environmental footprint left by their actions.",
