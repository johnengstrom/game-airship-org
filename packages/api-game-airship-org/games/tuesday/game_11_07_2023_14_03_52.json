  "gameTitle": "Project Air: The Pangolin Mission",
  "gameDescription": "Assume control of precisely engineered airships to take part in an urgent mission. The aim? Saving pangolins from the brink of extinction. These innocent creatures face continuous threats due to the relentless illegal wildlife trade. As the crews navigate vast distances to collect and deliver these endangered creatures to safe havens, environmental sustainability remains crucial. Intelligence and efficient hydrogen usage are your most potent tools in this race against time to rescue the world's most heavily trafficked mammal.",
