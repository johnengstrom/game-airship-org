  "gameDescription": "Two advanced airships are dispatched on a mission critical for species survival. Their task: Safely and efficiently transport rescued pangolins from Africa to a new sanctuary enclosure in Vietnam. Each strategic decision made by the team affects the success of the mission, the wellbeing of the pangolins, and the environmental impact. The choice isn't just about winning; it's about ensuring the safety of the world's most trafficked wild mammal.",
