  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Rescuers: Airship Aid",
  "gameDescription": "In an era where pangolins, earth's most heavily poached creatures, are on the brink of extinction, two airship teams, 'Aegis Antaeus' and 'Titan Gaia' have been mandated to conduct a rescue mission. Transporting these vulnerable creatures from Africa to a new sanctuary in Vietnam, these teams aim to make a significant impact on their survival. Each action taken on this mission will ultimately influence not just the survival of the pangolins but the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
