  "gameDescription": "Two elite airship teams, the Sky Saviors and the Cloud Crusaders, embark on a mission of utmost importance: to rescue pangolins, the world's most heavily trafficked wild mammals, from poachers in Africa and transport them to a new sanctuary in Vietnam. This mission is heavily laced with unpredictability and danger. The cargo is precious and vulnerable, with each decision by the airship crews impacting not only the success of the mission but the future of the pangolins.",
