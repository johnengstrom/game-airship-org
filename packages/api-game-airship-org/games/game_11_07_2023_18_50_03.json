  "gameTitle": "Airships Ascend: The Pangolin Rescue Mission",
  "gameDescription": "In a near future where airships safeguard humanity's best hopes, two teams, the 'Biodome Falcons' and the 'Aegis Albatross', navigate treacherous terrains and unprecedented challenges as they embark on a ground-breaking mission to rescue and relocate endangered pangolins. Operating on advanced AI controls, these airships transport these fragile creatures from poaching-prone areas in Africa to a newly minted sanctuary in Vietnam. Decisions made throughout this high-stakes mission will influence not only the success of the operation, but also the teams' enviromental footprint and potential to cultivate much-needed empathy for our planet's endangered species.",
