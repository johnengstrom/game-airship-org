  "gameDescription": "In this age of exploration and tourism, the untouched wilderness of Antarctica becomes opportunity and responsibility for the players. As captains of advanced airships, you must plan your voyage in this fragile ecosystem, balancing the surge of tourism with the urgent need to protect Antarctica's unique biodiversity. Each decision made has a potential impact on the environment and the success of your mission, so navigate wisely.",
