  "gameTitle": "Operation Pollination",
  "gameDescription": "In this near future, players control intelligent airships in a crucial mission to restore global bee populations and their habitats affected by both natural disasters and human activities. The teams are represented as The Red Team: 'The Apis Aviators' and The Blue Team: 'The Bombus Navigators'. The decisions made by each team impact the survival of the bees and hence the overall health of ecosystems. The game is filled with technical, environmental and strategic decisions providing a thoughtful gaming experience.",
