  "gameDescription": "Two futuristic airships, 'Serpica Naro' and 'Manis Max', are on a noble mission. Many shy pangolins have faced the relentless threat of illegal wildlife trade, making them the most trafficked wild mammal worldwide. Poaching claims the lives of up to 2.7 million annually. Now, new hope arises as Greater Good Charities and Wildlife At Risk act as harbingers of rescue - a pangolin enclosure, a safe haven and cornerstone in their survival, has been completed in Vietnam. The mission of the airships is to safely transport pangolins and necessary supplies to this new enclosure, ensuring their revival.",
