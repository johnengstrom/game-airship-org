  "gameDescription": "Two state-of-the-art airships, Skyward Serpent and Cloud Atlas, embark on a mission of mercy. Their task is to safely transport valuable pangolins from poaching hotspots in Africa to their brand-new, large-scale enclosure in Vietnam. Each team's decision directly affects the lives of these shy creatures and the overall success of the mission. As team members, players will face difficult choices that will test their decision-making skills and, ultimately, demonstrate the power of collective action in combating wildlife trafficking.",
