  "gameTitle": "Pangolin Patrol: The Aerospace Guardian",
  "gameDescription": "Two advanced airships, equipped with cutting-edge rescue modules and ecological surveillance systems, undertake a rescue mission to save pangolins, the fragile, heavily-trafficked mammals. They aim to transport rescued pangolins from various hot spots in Africa, Asia, and beyond to the newly constructed, enduring sanctuary in Vietnam. Each decision made by the airship teams profoundly impacts the success of the operation and the hopeful future of these endangered creatures.",
